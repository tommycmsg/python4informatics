# Python for Informatics Book Exercise 3.3 (Suggestions for improving Pythonic elegance Welcome!)
# Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the
# score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
# Score Grade
# >= 0.9 A
# >= 0.8 B
# >= 0.7 C
# >= 0.6 D
# < 0.6 F

inp = raw_input('Enter Score: ')
try: 
    score = float(inp)
    if score > 1.0:
        print 'error, out of range'
    elif score >= .9:
        print 'A'
    elif score >= .8:
        print 'B'
    elif score >= .7:
        print 'C'
    elif score >= .6:
        print 'D'
    elif score > 0.0 and score < .6:
        print 'F'
    elif score < 0.0:
        print 'error, out of range'
except:
    print 'error, enter numeric input'
