# Python for Informatics Book Exercise 3.2
# Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message 
# and exiting the program.

try:
    input = raw_input('Enter Hours: ')
    hours = float(input)
    input = raw_input('Enter Rate: ')
    rate = float(input)

    if hours <= 40:
        pay = hours * rate
  
    else:
        pay = rate * 40 + (rate * 1.5 * (hours - 40))
  
    print pay
    
except:

    print 'please enter a valid number'
